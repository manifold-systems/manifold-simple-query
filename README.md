# Manifold : Simple Query
The query API is very simple and not meant to be used for anything serious. This project primarily demonstrates usage of
the `ICompilerComponent` SPI as a means to perform AST transformations. It also uses other Manifold features along the
way, including extension methods, properties, `@Self`, and others.
